# Introduction

UPDB is an open database of unexplained phenomena reports.

## Tips

### Searching reports

## Database

The database is generated by the [updb-scrapers](https://github.com/uapublius/updb-scrapers) and [updb-importers](https://github.com/uapublius/updb-importers) projects.

## Server

[Postgrest](https://postgrest.org) serves a RESTful API of the database. See `server/postgrest.conf`.

## Client

### Dev

- Once you have postgrest listening on :4000
  - `npm run dev`
  - Vite will proxy `/api` to postgrest.

### Prod

`npm run build`

The app files are served, and postgrest is proxied, by an nginx instance. See `server/nginx.conf`.
